### 0.5.0

_Released 2025 Sep 29_

#### Improvements

- Implemented an `OmittableConverter` to convert wrapped values.
  - This is done in a new `omittable-spring-core` artifact.
  - Both WebFlux and WebMvc support artifacts automatically register the converter.

#### Fixes

- Correctly guard SpringDoc-related autoconfiguration. [[GH-39](https://github.com/Osmerion/Omittable/issues/39)]
  - This fixes an issue where application startup would fail if Swagger was present on the classpath but SpringDoc was
    not.
