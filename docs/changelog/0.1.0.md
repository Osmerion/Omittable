#### Overview

When developing RESTful APIs, it is often necessary to distinguish between the
absence of a value and a null value to support partial updates properly.

Consider a user profile with an integer ID, a name, and a birthday. Imagine a
user wants to update their name, but not their birthday. This could be
implemented by updating the entire profile:

```sh
curl -X PUT https://api.example.com/users/123 \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
        "name": "John Doe",
        "birthday": "2005-07-11T10:34:47+00:00"
    }'
```

In this case, the birthday is sent as well, even though it should not be
changed. Not only is this inefficient, but it also obscures the intent of the
user which makes it harder for the server to authorize the request.

A more practical and scalable approach is to use partial updates:

```sh
curl -X PATCH https://api.example.com/users/123 \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
        "name": "John Doe"
    }'
```

Here, the `birthday` field is omitted to indicate that the server should not
change the birthday. Similarly, if the user wants to remove their birthday from
their profile, they could explicitly set it to `null`:

```sh
curl -X PATCH https://api.example.com/users/123 \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
        "birthday": null
    }'
```

While this is a common pattern that makes for a clean API, it is tricky to
translate this into DTOs in most languages since there is typically no
difference between `null` and the absence of a value. The `Omittable` type
solves this by (re-)introducing a semantic distinction between the two.
