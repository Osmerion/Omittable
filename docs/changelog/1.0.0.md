### 1.0.0

_Released 2025 Nov 27_

#### Overview

This version marks the first stable release of the Omittable core library. The API is now officially stable and unlikely
to change in the future.

The modules providing support for integrating [Omittable](https://github.com/Osmerion/Omittable) with third-party
libraries and frameworks have been split off into their own repositories to simplify development of current and future
integrations.

This repository now only contains the code for the core library.
